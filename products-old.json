Meik's new book will teach you how to create and remember happy moments and will change how you think about happy memories.\" Dr Rangan Chatterjee, Number One bestselling author of The 4 Pillar Plan and BBC Breakfast GP",
    "aboutProduct": "The third book from the CEO of the Happiness Research Institute and internationally bestselling author of The Little Book of Hygge, Meik Wiking.\n\nWhy is it that a piece of music, a smell, a taste can take us back to something we had forgotten? How is it that we remember our first kiss in detail, but barely remember anything of a fortnight's holiday from five years ago? Memories are the cornerstones of our identity, shaping who we are, how we act, and how we feel. But how do we make and keep the memories that bring us lasting joy?\n\nHappiness expert Meik Wiking has the answers. In The Art of Making Memories he brings together his extensive research drawn from the world's biggest study on happy memories (which involved 1000 people from 75 countries), conducted at the Happiness Research Institute, along with data and diaries, interviews, global surveys and studies, and real-life behavioural science and happiness experiments, to explain the nuances of nostalgia, the different ways we form memories around our experiences, and how we can become better at recalling them.\n\nWritten in Meik's warm and funny trademark style, filled with infographics, illustrations, and photographs, and featuring \"Happy Memory Tips\", The Art of Making Memories a life-affirming read which show you it's easier than you think to make your life unforgettable.",

Nor is it just eating pastries, lighting candles, and practising hygge. Happiness is something available to all, wherever you are, and whatever your means. Starting from the Happiness Research Institute in Copenhagen, Meik Wiking, probably the happiest man in the world, travels across the globe on a quest to uncover the secrets of the very happiest people from Dubai to Rio de Janeiro, taking back to his native country their tips, tricks, and unique approaches to a fulfilled life.\n\nExploring the happiness gap for parents, how much money you really need to buy happiness, and why—luckily for us—the expectation of kissing Rachel Weiss is better than the real thing, Meik brings together a global roadmap for happiness with his trademark wit. Weaving together original research and personal anecdotes, The Little Book of Lykke gives us a new approach to achieving everyday happiness.",

Let the games begin and let the hygge vibes flow!",
    "aboutProduct": "Every picture tells a story - but what story will your picture tell? Dixit is the lovingly illustrated game of creative guesswork, where your imagination unlocks the tale. \n\nIn this award-winning board game, players will use the beautiful imagery on their cards to bluff their opponents and guess which image matches the story. Guessing right is only half the battle - to really succeed, you'll have to get your friends to decide that your card tells the story! Every turn, the storyteller will call out a short phrase or word to match the image on his card. Then each player will choose the card that most closely matches that phrase, and then everyone must guess which card the storyteller saw when he invented his brief tale. Correctly guess the storyteller's card, and you'll move ahead. Convince everyone else that your card is best, and you'll do even better. \n\nDixit is a wonderfully simple game, playable by nearly anyone with whom you share a common language. With a fantastic range of beautiful illustrations and rules that can be understood by children and adults alike, Dixit will appeal to anyone with an imagination. It's no surprise that Dixit won the Spiel de Jahres award for game design in 2010. It is brilliant and simple, beautiful and imaginative, and fun for all.",
